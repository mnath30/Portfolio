                <h3><i>Version Control and Git</i></h3>

                <p>
                    Version control helps to manage and track the changes made to software code. Every time any changes
                    are made, they are all tracked and documented which in turn helps the developers to go back to the
                    code, compare the earlier versions of the code and revert to the last working code if the new
                    functionality messes up the code in any way. This makes the developer's job a lot easier. Also,
                    multiple team members can independently work on separate features of the same project without
                    worrying about conflicts and then they can merge their changes after they finish their work to the
                    master branch. If any conflicts occur or errors are encountered when any new changes are merged, the
                    developers always have the option to go back to the last working code and undo the changes. Cool
                    right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still remember when I had no idea about what version control was and each time when I wanted to
                    make any changes to the code of my projects, I used to save the entire code in other folder and then
                    make changes to the code. This resulted in several versions of the entire project being saved at
                    multiple locations and occupying a lot of space. Also, it was very difficult to track all the
                    changes made. So once I came to know about Git and GitHub, it seemed like a blessing.
                </p>
                <b><i>What is Git and GitHub?</i></b>
                <p>
                    Let us first learn about Git. Git is a open-source distributed version control system. It
                    helps the users to track the changes every time any new feature is added with the help of messages. 
                    These messages help the users to understand what changes were made at that point of time.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us understand this better by taking an example. Imagine that you are working on a project along
                    with two other team members and each one of you have decided to work on separate features of the
                    same project. So now all of you will be working independently and after completing your respective
                    features, each one of you can then merge your code together. So before starting you will all create
                    separate branches for working on your features and after completing, you will each merge your code
                    to the initial branch. If at any point of time after merging, the code breaks, then you can go
                    through the previous versions of the code and undo the changes by referring to the commit messages.
                    Git helps to keep track of source code history. All these Git repositories can then be stored in
                    GitHub.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What is GitHub you ask? Yea so GitHub is basically a cloud-based hosting service that lets us manage
                    all our git repositories. So, if I upload my project to GitHub then I will be able to download it
                    from there and work on it from anywhere. I don’t have to worry about always carrying my laptop
                    around with me to work on my project. This is the best thing about storing things on cloud. Not only
                    me, if I make my project public on GitHub, anyone will be able to see and access it.
                </p>
                <b><i>Alternatives to GitHub</i></b>
                <p>
                    We also have various alternatives to GitHub like BitBucket, GitLab, SourceForge, AWS CodeCommit,
                    etc.
                </p>

                <b><i>Let us now see some of the most used git commands and what do they do:</i></b>

                <br>
                <b><i>Git Init</i></b>
                <p>User can use this command to create a new Git repository.
                </p>
                <b><i>Command: git init</i></b>

                <br><hr>
                <b><i>Git Clone</i></b>
                <p>This command is used to download the entire git repository from the remote location to user’s local
                    machine. </p>
                <b><i>Command: git clone "URL of remote repository" </i></b>

                <br><hr>
                <b><i>Git Branch</i></b>
                <p>This command is used to create separate branches of the same repository which allows users to work
                    independently on different parts of the same project </p>
                <b><i>Command: git branch 'branchname'</i></b>
                    <br><hr>
                <b><i>Git Checkout</i></b>
                <p>Once user creates new branches, user can use this command to switch to the other branches.</p>
                <b><i>Command: git checkout </i></b>

                <br><hr>
                <b><i>Git Add</i></b>
                <p>Before pushing code to the remote repository, the user needs to add all the files where the changes
                    were made to the staging area which informs git to track the changes of those files. This command is
                    used to add the files to the staging area.</p>
                <b><i>Command: git add 'filename'</i></b>

                <br><hr>
                <b><i>Git Commit</i></b>
                <p>This command is used to commit the changes i.e save the changes to the directory where user is working. Every time commit is executed, the user has to enter a meaningful message which helps the
                    user or any other team member to understand what changes were made.</p>
                <b><i>Command: Git commit -m 'commit message'</i></b>

                <br><hr>
                <b><i>Git Push</i></b>
                <p>This command is used to push all the changes made by the user locally to the remote repository which
                    can then be accessed and modified by other team members</p>
                <b><i>Command: Git push "remote" "branchname"</i></b>

                <br><hr>
                <b><i>Git Pull</i></b>
                <p>This command is used to pull all the changes made by any other team members in user’s local machine
                    and merge the changes with the user’s local copy.</p>
                <b><i>Command: Git pull "remote"</i></b>

                <br><hr>
                <b><i>Git Log</i></b>
                <p>This command displays the entire commit history</p>
                <b><i>Command: Git log</i></b>

                <br><hr>
                <b><i>Git Merge</i></b>
                <p>This command is used to merge any new branches created by the user into the current branch.</p>
                <b><i>Command: git merge "branch"</i></b>

                <br><hr>
                <p>
                    So to sum it all up, version control is used to track and manage changes to software code. Git is an
                    open source distributed version control system that manages and tracks the code source code history
                    and GitHub is a cloud based hosting service that is used to store and manage all the git
                    repositories on cloud.
