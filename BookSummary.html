                <h3><i>The 5 Am club book Summary </i></h3>
                <br>
                <p class="right-align">
                    Few years back I came across this wonderful book <b>‘The 5 Am club’ </b>written by <b>Robin
                        Sharma</b>. I had heard about him before but had never read any of his books not even his
                    bestselling book <b>‘The Monk Who sold His Ferrari’</b>. I came across this book since I was
                    searching for some kind of solution to my weird sleeping habits. I really have a very hard time
                    sleeping early and which in turn makes it impossible for me to wake up early. After reading the
                    title of this book I thought that maybe this book might provide the solution to this sleeping habit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After reading the book, I really fell in love with the book. Not only the book provides the benefits
                    and the tactics of waking up early but also provides many such formulas and methods which in turn
                    help in improving the overall quality of work, health, mind, and soul.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the key points described in the book is the <i><b>20/20/20 formula</b></i> which is to be
                    followed after getting up at 5 am. The first pocket of 20 minutes is for exercising and sweating it
                    out from 5:00 am to 5:20 am. The second pocket from 5:20 am to 5:40 am is for reflecting where the
                    author encourages to journal, meditate, plan, pray and contemplate. This activity increases
                    positivity and improves our mood and performance. The third pocket from 5.40 am to 6 am is to grow
                    i.e., review goals, read books, study, or listen to good podcasts for really becoming good at out
                    skill and for our persona growth. I have tried this formula and found that waking up early when most
                    people are asleep and already completing these steps provide a sense of accomplishment and joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other interesting methods that I found in this book include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The habit installation protocol</b></li>
                        <p class="right-align">
                            This protocol talks about the installation of habits which require consistency and
                            persistency. It takes around 66 days to install any new habit after which it becomes second
                            nature to us.
                        </p>
                        <li><b>The Journaling Habit</b></li>
                        <p class="right-align">
                            The habit of journaling allows us to achieve a great deal of clarity and awareness.
                            Journaling can be anything from writing about our day, writing about the things which we are
                            grateful for or writing about our plans and goals.
                        </p>
                        <li><b>The pre-sleep ritual of iconic producers</b></li>
                        <p class="right-align">
                            A proper sleep is very important to ensure good health and peak productivity, so the book
                            suggests a proper step by step plan to be followed before sleeping. We should have our last
                            meal and switch off all our devices before 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm. 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm is the
                            time reserved for our family members or a second period of meditation. Finally, 9:00 pm to
                            10:00 pm is the time to go to bed in a dark and technology free bedroom.
                        </p>

                        <li><b>The 90/90/1 Rule</b></li>
                        <p class="right-align">
                            This is my personal favourite. In 90/90/1 rule, we have to take one activity which we feel
                            is very important for us and do that activity everyday in the first 90 minutes of our
                            workday for 90 days. I feel this is the best way to learn something new.
                        </p>

                        <li><b>The 60/10 method</b></li>
                        <p class="right-align">
                            This 60/10 method tells us to work at our best for 60 minutes straight without any
                            distraction and then take a 10-minute recovery break.
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="right-align">
                    These are only a few handful of ideas which are my personal favourites. If you liked these ideas,
                    then I am sure you would love the book too. I hope you read the book and would love to discuss your
                    thoughts as well. Do you have any favourite books that helped shape up your life? Do let me know.
